How do you quickly determine whether a VAST feed is empty?  Parse the XML response, look for tell tale signs, then make a determination.

Another super duper hacky way is to ping the VAST URL and check the response's length in characters.  If the character length is below a certain threshold, there is a good chance there is something wrong with the tag.  This is that super duper hacky approach.

My last time writing PHP, too!
